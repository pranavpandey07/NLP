And more than decent camera."

The display quality is good, but the notch is too big, and also curve at bottom seems to waste a good amount of space.. so, not full view exactly.

Also compared to Xiaomi phones like Mi4i, the build is not as sturdy, and IR blaster is a minor miss too."

4,"The phone is wonderful and a good value for money. The display quality is good, but the notch is too big, and also curve at bottom seems to waste a good amount of space.. so, not full view exactly. The top area on both sides of notch could have been used better, now nothing much useful information shown there. Also compared to Xiaomi phones like Mi4i, the build is not as sturdy, and IR blaster is a minor miss too."

5,"It's been 2 yrs, still a beast. It's the best phone one can get if they know certain things like flashing a custom rom. I'm using it with pixel experience rom. And the top notch camera makes it a great phone. No phone comes remotely close for this price range even after 2 yrs."

4,using this for one month....
5,"Simply Excellent! Got the 64gb device yesterday. Was expecting cheap quality as its polycarbonate. It turned out to be great. Very well built. In fact felt like my old HTC M8 cuz of its weight n display n touch quality. Camera and sounds are so good because of the AI processor in Snapdragon 845. I need not say about battery n performance, fantastic. The camera focus is the fastest I have seen. The only con I felt was it could have been named better. POCO sounds cheap initially. Overall its th..."
3,"The phone is superb and top notch. Best priced phone in indian market right now. But your exchange policy of phone sucks big time. The person who came to check denied to take my mum's phone for a ""scratch"" which only he could see . Neither my mom or my dad or my entire neighbourhood could see or feel the fault. Adding to this he also said that the colour of the phone has faded !!! What were you expecting to be honest? A new phone? I am giving it up in exchange offer because its old only right..."

5,"Many people complained about the low light performance of the camera. Well, I have to accept that it can't match zenfone 5z or OP6 for point and shoot photography in low light due to its smaller aperture. But it has a capable manual mode, which can be used to get decent quality pics. Keep the iso maximum upto 400 to keep noise in check, change the shutter speed (which can be set to a whopping THIRTY SECONDS!!) to get optimum lighting. It takes patience but it works. Also make sure that the ph..."

Overall its th..."

I just have one fear thay it won't get Android Q update because of POCO brand allegedly closing down. other than that I quite literally have no complaints.

4,great phone.. camera is awesome.. captures beautiful photos.. look is nice.. can't say about battery..it's fine on an average..as my brother Plays pub G on it... just a bit disappointed because of not having gorilla glass.. but overall he is happy with his phone.. Thank you FLIPKART.
4,"Nice phone display could be more better. Performance is good but sometimes games lag like pubg. battery is charged fast but drain is bit faster than expected from xiaomi devices. camera is good pro mode option is there. IR face lock is quite fast and fingerprint also works faster than expected. in daylight u can get awesome pictures from rear camera. in this price if u r a gamer, then is a good option to go for it as it also heats slowly due to its liquid cooling technology."

Starting with performance which has been the USP of this product is really swift and almost flawless, can watch hd content or play high end games for long without any lag,the phone do warm up a bit though. Selfie camera is great and rear camera does the job too."

4,"Nice phone display could be more better. Performance is good but sometimes games lag like pubg. battery is charged fast but drain is bit faster than expected from xiaomi devices. camera is good pro mode option is there. IR face lock is quite fast and fingerprint also works faster than expected. in daylight u can get awesome pictures from rear camera. in this price if u r a gamer, then is a good option to go for it as it also heats slowly due to its liquid cooling technology."

Starting with performance which has been the USP of this product is really swift and almost flawless, can watch hd content or play high end games for long without any lag,the phone do warm up a bit though. Selfie camera is great and rear camera does the job too."

Install Google camera for better photography. Night sight works excellent. Overall satisfied with my phone."

5,"it has great specs when compared to Redmi note series. It has compass as well. 6gb and 128gb for 24000 is quite a great deal for the consumers. Camera is too good and lots of storage means, you need not worry about taking too many photos. even better performance you will get with google camera.This phone is the best one in this range and specs. Phone deserves 10 of 10. Speed is very good and other phones look average compared to this."

5,"Got my phone yesterday. Haven't played games yet. But till now phone feels way faster than my redmi note 3. Sound quality is way better and loud. Battery life is also awesome. Same 4000 mAh lasts longer on Snapdragon 845 coz of 10 nm finfet construction. UFS 2.1 storage is way faster compared to redmi devices. I am loving the notch also. Also feels very good and solid phone in hand. While touching and screen, it feels like I am using a Samsung S series phone. 5 stars to this product at 18,900..."

5,"I bought it in the first sale. So it's been over a month. Obviously the performance and battery life are good. The display has good contrast for an lcd panel. Visibility is good outdoors. Fast charging is very handy. The camera sensor is very capable. If only it had a bigger aperture, it would beat the OnePlus6.  IR face scan works well especially in the dark. The vibration feels good unlike most OnePlus phones. I see a lot of buzz about the issues with this phone. But believe me, none of the..."

5,"I was once a One Plus fan waiting to get my hands on the One Plus One device, the excitement and the thrill was same with the arrival of Poco F1 by Xiaomi. The same 'Master of Speed' rightly suits this device. I want performance and battery in my new phone, so Poco F1 is right choice for me. Liquid cooling was another feat that made my decision on sticking with Poco F1. Cheers!"

5,writing this after 10 days of use.its a great phone that you can buy but there are some cons like the camera provides a yellowish tint to every photo. the software isn't that well polished well built quality can be a concern for some but I didn't have a problem with it's from what it's made of (polycarbonate) it has the best quality among any polycarbonated phones and if we talk about the pros well everything is on the table from its SOC to Skins everything is great.

5,This is my sixth touch screen smart phone (1) Samsung CDMA mobile phone (2) Samsung Galaxy S3 (3) Blackberry Q5 (4) One plus x (5) Moto 5s plus and now this (6) Poco F1. In my opinion Poco F1 beats all my earlier used smart phones and is on par with One plus 6 which my son is using at present. Hence in my opinion Poco F1 is one of the best mobile phones at present. BEST MOBILE PHONE IN ALL ASPECTS.

5,writing this after 10 days of use.its a great phone that you can buy but there are some cons like the camera provides a yellowish tint to every photo. the software isn't that well polished well built quality can be a concern for some but I didn't have a problem with it's from what it's made of (polycarbonate) it has the best quality among any polycarbonated phones and if we talk about the pros well everything is on the table from its SOC to Skins everything is great.

5,This is my sixth touch screen smart phone (1) Samsung CDMA mobile phone (2) Samsung Galaxy S3 (3) Blackberry Q5 (4) One plus x (5) Moto 5s plus and now this (6) Poco F1.

It feels great in hand and have nothing new to say about the prosessor , it is super fast and liquid cool works like magic. When you stars heavy work its initially heats up a bit and then suddenly liquid cool starts its work and it cools down and stay so no matter how heavy you use the poco. It also supports Google's AR Core, so the phone is future ready and you can do sum fun stuff with it."

3,Good product but 18:9 screen ratio leads to lower width. Also bottom curves result in hiding of corners in game and videos. Notification light is very small and at bottom. Moreover gets hidden when you go to lockscreen. Did not find much difference while playing games when compared to other mid range phones like mi max.

5,"This phone is a beast. Performance is very gud due it's powerful sd 845 processor. Camera is best you can get at this price. ir face unlock works really well even in absolute darkness. Was never a big fan of mi ui but this phone has different one just for poco phone most importantly the app drawer, i like it. The only downside is it's design, build quality is good but glass back would have been better. However after putting the back cover it's like any other well built phone."

I would highly recommend this phone at 20K budget. Best Xiomai phone till date..
5,"This phone is a beast. Performance is very gud due it's powerful sd 845 processor. Camera is best you can get at this price. ir face unlock works really well even in absolute darkness. Was never a big fan of mi ui but this phone has different one just for poco phone most importantly the app drawer, i like it. The only downside is it's design, build quality is good but glass back would have been better. However after putting the back cover it's like any other well built phone."

5,actually I got this beast at 22k during Diwali sale. First of all several people panicking about Op5 & 6 with this device. But needless to say people always expect a phone around 20k with all better feature. Bit how those people compare with a 30+k phone.

4,A great buy for the price. But have to compromise on the display which is not that great when compared to amoled. Battery life is excellent. The stereo speaker is a gimmick as the earpiece speaker produces only a feeble sound.

It's a daily driver with flagship experience. Just go for it before they get stopped and that outdated notch isn't much to be worried at all."

It covers all the major things like processor , camera battery (which is btw best I've seen in any flagship device). And I don't understand why people were concerned about it's build quality. Yes it is made of polycarbonate but it doesn't feels cheap in hand. I got it for Rs 19999/- and I am sure that there won't be any phone in next 6-8 months ..."

5,"Bought this device on Sep 2018. Its been 2 years and there is nothing wrong with performance, battery or camera. But having issue with earpiece volume during calls recently. I think its something to do with the software update. Hoping it will get resolved in near future. Workaround is to use earphones. Other than that this phone really has the  ability to go for another 2 years for moderate users. Cheers!!"

Although there is a slight degradation in performance, battery life and camera quality, it still competes with same price range latest models. You'll find the notch huge as compared to dew drop notch in latest mobiles. Supports Miui 12."
